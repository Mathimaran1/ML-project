# Machine Learning Mini Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a machine learning project. The notebook guides through various stages of a machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Contents

- `mlminiproject.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all the code and steps for the machine learning pipeline.

## Features

- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling)
- Feature selection and extraction
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of model performance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before running the notebook:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mlminiproject.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd mlminiproject
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open the `mlminiproject.ipynb` file in the browser.

3. Execute each cell in the notebook to follow the steps of the machine learning project.

## Usage

- Replace the dataset or modify the parameters as needed.
- Experiment with different machine learning models, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate performance metrics.

## Results

- After running the notebook, you will get performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualizations will be generated for data distribution, model evaluation, and comparison.

## Dependencies

The following libraries are used in the project:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

To install all dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
